# 📊 Day 1: Exploratory Statistics with Python

Welcome to **Day 1** of the **100 Days of Data Mastery** journey!  
Today’s focus is on exploring fundamental statistical concepts using Python.  
We review key descriptive statistics and visualize data distributions using real-world datasets.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and calculate key statistical metrics (mean, median, mode, std, variance, etc.).
- Use Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scipy` for basic statistical analysis.
- Generate and interpret visual representations of data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Apply statistical analysis to a real dataset.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.9
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## 📌 Key Concepts Covered

* Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
* Dispersion: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
* Skewness and Kurtosis
* Histogram and Boxplot Interpretation
* Handling Missing Values

## 📊 Dataset Used

To make statistics more relatable, we use **synthetic age data** to simulate everyday scenarios.
For example, a dataset with ages of people from a community or school helps us understand:

* What’s the average age?
* Are most people in their 20s or 30s?
* Is the distribution skewed toward younger or older people?

This kind of dataset makes it easier to visualize how statistical concepts apply in real life.

You can later extend this using any dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/).

## ✅ Output Examples

* **Text Summary**: Key metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation are saved in `outputs/summary_statistics.txt`.
* **Histograms**: Visual representation of the age distribution, saved in `outputs/histograms.png`.
* **Notebook Insights**: Inline visualizations and explanations for each concept.
